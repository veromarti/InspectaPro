# Main Process Flow

## 1. Company Registration

The process begins when a company registers in the system and creates its organizational profile.

This establishes the operational environment.
## 2. System Configuration

The Company Administrator configures the system by:

- Creating users
- Assigning roles
- Defining inspection types

This prepares the system for operational use.
## 3. Inspection Creation

The Company Administrator creates a new inspection based on a predefined inspection type.

The inspection is initially in a pending state.
## 4. Assignment

A technician is assigned to the inspection.

The responsibility for execution is now clearly defined.
## 5. Execution

The technician performs the inspection and submits the results.

The inspection moves to a review state.
## 6. Validation

The Company Administrator reviews the submitted results.

The inspection can be:

- Approved and validated
- Rejected and returned for correction
## 7. Closure

Once validated, the inspection is closed.

The process ends and the inspection becomes read-only.
